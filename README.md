# About this project 
This project represent a way to calculate and draw functions like Polynom, and Complex Functions.
# The functions: 
* Function- All kind of functions- Monom, Polynom, ComplexFunction.
* Monom- A simple monom in type of a*x^b, a,b are real numbers.
* Polynom- A list of monoms which togther representing Polynom.
* ComplexFunction- function in type of O(f1,f2), O- operations like mul,plus,divide,min,max,complex , f1 and f2 are instance of function.
# Example of functions:
* Monom- 3x^2, -5.4x^-4, 9x,-9.
* Polynom- 9,2x, 4x^2, -5x^2-4x+2.
* Complex function- plus(4x,2x^2), div(2x^5+1, mul(2x,4x+1)), comp(5x^2+2x, plus(2x,15x^2).

# Methods
* F: to calculate f(x) for a given x.
* Derivative: to return a derivative of Polynom.
* Equals: Test if two functions are logically equals.
* Math operations: Compute operations (like plus,multiply, divide, complex,max,min) between 2 functions. 
* Area: Compute a Riman's integral from x0 to x1 in epsilon steps for a Polynom.
* Root: Compute a value x' of a Polynom (x0<=x'<=x1) for which |f(x')| < eps. assuming (f(x0)*f(x1)<=0.
* Draw: to draw a function or collection of functions using StdDraw librariy. 
* Save/Load: to save/load a collection of functions to/from your pc.
